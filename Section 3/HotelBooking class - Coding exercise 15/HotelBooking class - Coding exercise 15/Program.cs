/* HotelBooking class

Define a public HotelBooking class, which will contain the following fields that must be accessible outside of this class:

    GuestName (string)

    StartDate and EndDate (DateTimes)

The constructor of this class should take the following parameters (please maintain the given order and names):

    guestName (string)

    startDate (DateTime)

    lengthOfStayInDays (int)

The constructor should set all fields of this class.

The EndDate should be calculated in the constructor as the StartDate plus the lengthOfStayInDays . You can use the AddDays method from the DateTime type to calculate it. You can do it right in the constructor body.
