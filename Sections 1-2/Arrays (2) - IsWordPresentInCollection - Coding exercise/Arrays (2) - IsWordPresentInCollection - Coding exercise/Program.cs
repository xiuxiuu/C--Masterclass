/* Arrays (2) - IsWordPresentInCollection

Implement the IsWordPresentInCollection method, which given an array of words and a wordToBeChecked, returns true if wordToBeChecked is present in this collection and false otherwise.

For example:

    For words equal to {"one", "two", "three"} and wordToBeChecked equal to "hello" the result shall be false because the word "hello" is not present in the words array.

    For words equal to {"one", "two", "three"} and wordToBeChecked equal to "two" the result shall be true because the word "two" is present in the words array.
